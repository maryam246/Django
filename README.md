In  main folder 'db.sqlite3' file is made when we migrate. sqlite use default database of django.
- make **templates** folder in which we keep all html files.
- make **static folder** in which we keep all static data like CSS , Javascript , IMAGES ,Fonts.
- make **media**  keep all dynamic files, like dynamic images.
## How to  migrate default Migrations?
- Default Migrations:
    - Some tabels schema is by default is created.
    - To open admin panel we make the super user who able to open admin panel. So, to create super user we should first migrate.
    - Thier is 2 commands 1st one is:
    - **python manage.py makemigrations** it used when make new model to convert in migration through makemigration.After that we use this below command for migrations,
    - **python mange.py**
    - we do not need to create migrations beacuse already default migrationis present.

## Urls & Views
Urls(Route) is also called Routes.
like (

    https://www.MyWebsite.com/ ----> Showing starting page

    https://www.MyWebsite.com/blog/ ---->Show list of all posts

    https://www.MyWebsite.com/blog/siglepost ---->Show Specify post
)

- Views:
   -The logic executed for different URLs (https Method)

            - Functions         - Class
views is bassically connect with urls, when user open the urls then url hit the view which associate those urls.
- so, for connecting purpose of urls, and view we make the urls.py in which we define all urls.py file and also make the view.py file in which we create our class and funtion.

## Creating Django URLs & Views
- To show the response of urls on site we use HttpRespons in views.py.
In our main project name same name file exist in my creating website the name is MyWebsite inside this same name file MyWebsite is present in which we create the views.py file. in which you create python functions and classes.
- We will create as many URLs on our website as the number of views we generate
- To display the view on site first we import the views.py in urls.py, then set the function view path in urls.py.

## Create dynamic URLs in Django
Dynamic routes/urls is create in three ways.
- int
- starting
- slug  (slud type data is like this hello-My-Website)

## Render a HTML templates as response
- create html page-->in templates
- connect the html file---> in settings.py
- make function---> in viwes.py 
  -for this purpose import **from django.shortcuts import render**

- all html data is store in templates file which we created in starting.
- To Render a HTML templates as response, For this purpose we import the library.It renderd the html page.
    - **from django.shortcuts import render**
    - render takes two argument 1st paremeter is 
       - request     and 2nd is  - Your page name
- In setting.py folder in this templates directory is set.
- In setting.py folder goes in  Templates varible. in this variable directory is present with this name ** DIRS** 
- in directory keep templates in directory. like this
   - [BASE_DIR,"templates"]

## Difference btw HttpRespons AND Render
-Render is usally used to load the templates or context, on the other hand, HttpRespons is ually for data.
- HttpRespons is not able to call the Html page,
but render is able to call the html page.
- If you want just show the text on website use HttpRespons.
- if you want to call the html page then impoer render module from django.shortcuts.
